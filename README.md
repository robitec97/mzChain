# mzChain

**mzChain** is a blockchain project developed in **C#** using **.NET Core**, with the goal of creating a decentralized and purpose-driven network.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- The `src/` folder contains a ready-to-use **Visual Studio solution**, including all the source `.cs` files and dependencies required to get started.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The mission of mzChain is to build a **fully distributed blockchain** utilizing a **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** consensus algorithm. Unlike traditional blockchains, mzChain is focused on **social impact and community contribution**.

### 💰 Initial Coin Distribution

The initial supply of the native coin will be distributed through two main mechanisms:

1. **Mining Rewards** – For securing the network and validating transactions.  
2. **Task-Based Contributions** *(to be defined)* – Participants will be rewarded for completing tasks related to **charitable**, **environmental**, or other socially beneficial initiatives.

> The core vision of mzChain is to become a vehicle for spreading **kindness** and **positivity** in the world.

## 💡 What does “mz” stand for?

The name **“mz”** comes from the initials of my beloved grandfather, who passed away in 2022. 
He was a **kind and humble man** who always dreamed of studying, but life didn’t give him the opportunity.

This project is dedicated to his memory.  
Through mzChain, I hope to honor him by creating something that empowers people who never had their fair shot—offering them new possibilities and a voice in a decentralized world.
